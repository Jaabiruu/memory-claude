# CLAUDE.md - Memory Bank Workflow Framework

This file provides Claude Code with a comprehensive workflow system based on cursor-memory-bank's methodology, adapted for CLI usage with native Claude Code capabilities.

## Core Workflow Philosophy

**Cognitive Specialization Over Simplification**
- Maintain 6 specialized workflow modes for optimal cognitive performance
- Each mode optimizes for different thinking patterns and development phases
- Seamless CLI integration with context window management
- Think tool strategic integration for complex reasoning

**Fractal Workflow Architecture**
- Apply full 6-mode workflow to complex subtasks when beneficial
- Create tight feedback loops between project-level and subtask-level work
- Enable cognitive specialization at multiple levels of granularity
- Improve quality through iterative refinement at both levels

## Workflow Modes Overview

### Sequential Workflow Progression
```
@VAN → @PLAN → @CREATIVE → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT → @ARCHIVE
```

**Mode Specializations:**
- **@VAN**: Systems thinking, complexity assessment, project analysis
- **@PLAN**: Strategic planning, implementation roadmap, resource allocation
- **@CREATIVE**: Divergent thinking, design exploration, architectural decisions
- **@IMPLEMENT**: Convergent execution, code development, feature implementation
- **@REFLECT**: Critical analysis, quality assessment, testing validation
- **@ARCHIVE**: Pattern recognition, knowledge consolidation, documentation

## Context Window Management

### Automatic Context Monitoring
- **50% Context Usage**: Warning mode - prepare for documentation
- **60% Context Usage**: Documentation mode - create session snapshot
- **70% Context Usage**: Compaction mode - force preservation and /compact

### Context Preservation Protocol
When context threshold is reached:

1. **Document Current State**
   - Create session snapshot with timestamp
   - Document current mode and workflow position
   - Record immediate next steps and priorities
   - Note files being worked on and pending decisions

2. **Extract Knowledge**
   - Save patterns discovered during implementation
   - Document solutions found for problems
   - Record architectural insights and decisions
   - Save reusable code snippets and approaches
   - **Apply intelligent curation**: Automatically evaluate discoveries using quality thresholds

3. **Create Continuation Instructions**
   - Write clear self-reminder for resumption
   - Specify context needed for smooth continuation
   - List key files and functions to review
   - Include validation commands to run

4. **Execute Compaction**
   - Run `/compact` command to clear context
   - Preserve all critical information in memory-bank files
   - Enable seamless workflow resumption

### Post-Compaction Resumption
After `/compact` execution:
1. Read `active-session/continuation-prompt.md`
2. Review `active-session/workflow-state.md`
3. Validate current project state against latest snapshot
4. Resume workflow from documented position with full context

## Complexity-Based Routing

### Project Complexity Assessment
**Level 1 (Simple)**: Single feature, minimal dependencies
- Workflow: @VAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT
- Subtask Approach: Simple subtasks complete in single mode

**Level 2 (Moderate)**: Multiple features, some complexity
- Workflow: @VAN → @PLAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT
- Subtask Approach: Complex subtasks may use mini-workflows

**Level 3 (Complex)**: System changes, architectural decisions
- Workflow: @VAN → @PLAN → @CREATIVE → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT → @ARCHIVE
- Subtask Approach: Most subtasks use appropriate mode sequences

**Level 4 (Enterprise)**: Large scale, multiple systems, team coordination
- Workflow: Full 6-mode with multiple iterations and validation cycles
- Subtask Approach: All complex subtasks use full fractal workflows

### Fractal Workflow Activation
**Subtask Complexity Thresholds:**
- **Simple Subtask**: Single mode execution (e.g., @IMPLEMENT only)
- **Moderate Subtask**: 2-3 mode sequence (e.g., @VAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT)
- **Complex Subtask**: Full 6-mode workflow if beneficial
- **Critical Subtask**: Always use full workflow for high-impact tasks

## Fractal Workflow System

### Core Concept
The fractal workflow applies the full 6-mode cognitive specialization to individual subtasks when beneficial, creating tight feedback loops and higher quality outcomes through iterative refinement.

### Fractal Workflow Benefits
1. **Enhanced Quality**: Each subtask receives full cognitive specialization
2. **Tight Feedback Loops**: Rapid iteration and improvement at subtask level
3. **Risk Reduction**: Early identification of issues within subtasks
4. **Knowledge Accumulation**: Continuous learning and pattern recognition
5. **Scalable Complexity**: Handle complex subtasks with same rigor as projects

- Establish subtask success criteria

#### 2. Subtask Planning (@SUBTASK-PLAN)
- Develop subtask implementation strategy
- Identify subtask dependencies and risks
- Plan subtask testing and validation
- Estimate subtask effort and timeline

#### 3. Subtask Design (@SUBTASK-CREATIVE)

### Fractal Workflow Triggers

**Automatic Triggers:**
- Subtask estimated effort > 4 hours
- Subtask involves architectural decisions
- Subtask has multiple dependencies
- Subtask affects system-wide functionality
- Subtask involves new technology or patterns

**Manual Triggers:**
- Use `@FRACTAL-WORKFLOW [task]` command
- High-risk or critical subtasks
- Subtasks with unclear requirements
- Subtasks requiring creative exploration
- Subtasks with complex validation needs

### Context Management in Fractal Workflows

**Nested Context Preservation:**
- Project-level context preserved separately from subtask context
- Subtask context snapshots created at each mode transition
- Automatic escalation to project-level preservation if needed
- Cross-level context synchronization and validation

**Knowledge Integration:**
- Subtask patterns added to project knowledge base
- Subtask solutions integrated with project solutions
- Subtask decisions linked to project-level decisions
- Continuous knowledge accumulation across levels

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Sacred Principles
- **tasks.md is SACRED** - Single source of truth, never optional
- **Never skip @VAN mode** - Required initialization for all workflows
- **Follow complexity routing** - Level 1-4 determines required workflow path
- **Complete mode transitions** - Must meet exit criteria before proceeding
- **Preserve context automatically** - Never lose progress to context limits

### Mode Transition Gates
Each mode has specific entry and exit criteria:
- **Entry**: Required files and context must be present
- **Processing**: Mode-specific instructions and Think tool integration
- **Exit**: Quality gates must be satisfied before mode transition
- **Validation**: Automatic validation of mode completion criteria

## Think Tool Integration

### Mode-Specific Think Tool Usage
- **@VAN**: Complex project analysis and task decomposition
- **@PLAN**: Multi-step implementation strategy and resource planning
- **@CREATIVE**: Design decision validation and alternative evaluation
- **@IMPLEMENT**: Progress validation and error prevention during coding
- **@REFLECT**: Comprehensive quality assessment and improvement identification
- **@ARCHIVE**: Pattern recognition and knowledge consolidation

### Think Tool Triggers
- Automatic Think tool activation for complex decisions
- Manual Think tool invocation with `@think [context]`
- Cross-mode reasoning validation at transition points
- Quality gate Think tool checkpoints

## Session Management

### CLI Session Integration
- Use `claude -c` for workflow continuity across sessions
- Automatic workflow state preservation
- Cross-session memory persistence through memory-bank files
- Progress tracking and validation across multiple CLI sessions

### Workflow State Tracking
- Current mode and position in workflow
- Tasks completed and remaining
- Files modified and their status
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Next steps and priorities
