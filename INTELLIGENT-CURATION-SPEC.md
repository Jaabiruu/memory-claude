# Intelligent Memory Curation System - Implementation Specification

**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Priority**: High enhancement to existing Claude Code Memory Bank framework
**Context**: This is the next major feature to be added to the completed workflow framework

## üéØ Implementation Context

### Current System Status
The Claude Code Memory Bank Workflow Framework is **COMPLETE and FUNCTIONAL** with:
- ‚úÖ 6-mode workflow system (@VAN, @PLAN, @CREATIVE, @IMPLEMENT, @REFLECT, @ARCHIVE)
- ‚úÖ Fractal workflow enhancement for complex subtasks
- ‚úÖ Context window management (50%/60%/70% thresholds)
- ‚úÖ Knowledge base structure and accumulation system
- ‚úÖ Repository uploaded to: https://github.com/Jaabiruu/cc-mb

### Next Enhancement Goal
Add **intelligent automatic curation** to prevent memory pollution and ensure only high-value information gets permanently stored in the knowledge base.

## üß† Core Concept

### Problem Statement
Currently, the memory bank accepts all information without quality filtering, which can lead to:
- Memory pollution with low-value information
- Cognitive overload when searching for relevant knowledge
- Reduced effectiveness of pattern recognition
- Manual overhead in deciding what to preserve

### Solution Overview
Implement an intelligent evaluation system that:
- **Automatically scores** information based on multiple criteria
- **Decides inclusion/exclusion** based on configurable thresholds
- **Prevents duplicate storage** through smart detection
- **Learns and improves** curation quality over time

## üìä Evaluation Framework

### Multi-Criteria Scoring System (0-10 scale each)

#### 1. Novelty Score (0-10)
- **10**: Completely new pattern/solution never seen before
- **7-9**: New variation of existing pattern with significant differences
- **4-6**: Moderate novelty with some unique aspects
- **1-3**: Minor variation of existing knowledge
- **0**: Exact duplicate of existing information

#### 2. Reusability Score (0-10)
- **10**: Highly reusable across many projects and contexts
- **7-9**: Reusable in similar project types or domains
- **4-6**: Moderate reusability with some adaptation needed
- **1-3**: Limited reusability, very context-specific
- **0**: Single-use only, no future application

#### 3. Impact Score (0-10)
- **10**: Critical to project success, major breakthrough
- **7-9**: Significant positive impact on project outcomes
- **4-6**: Moderate impact, noticeable improvement
- **1-3**: Minor impact, small optimization
- **0**: No measurable impact

#### 4. Generalizability Score (0-10)
- **10**: Applies broadly across domains and technologies
- **7-9**: Applies across similar technologies/domains
- **4-6**: Applies within specific technology stack
- **1-3**: Applies only to specific tools/libraries
- **0**: Extremely specific, no broader application

#### 5. Validation Score (0-10)
- **10**: Thoroughly tested and proven effective
- **7-9**: Well-tested with good evidence of effectiveness
- **4-6**: Some testing, appears to work well
- **1-3**: Limited testing, uncertain effectiveness
- **0**: Untested or known to be problematic

### Composite Score Calculation
```
Total Score = (Novelty √ó 0.25) + (Reusability √ó 0.25) + (Impact √ó 0.20) + (Generalizability √ó 0.15) + (Validation √ó 0.15)
Max Score = 10.0
```

### Technical Considerations
- Leverage existing Think tool integration patterns from workflow modes
- Use established file-based state management approach
- Integrate with existing context preservation and knowledge base systems
- Maintain consistency with existing command patterns and user interface

### Quality Considerations
- Start with conservative thresholds to prevent excluding valuable information
