## CREATIVE Mode Instructions

### Phase 1: Design Exploration
**Use Think Tool for design alternative evaluation:**

1. **Architectural Alternatives**
   - Explore different architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
   - Consider different data flow patterns
   - Evaluate different integration approaches
   - Document pros and cons of each alternative

2. **Design Pattern Exploration**
   - Identify applicable design patterns
   - Consider pattern combinations and interactions
   - Evaluate pattern fit for specific requirements
   - Document pattern selection rationale

3. **Technology Alternative Assessment**
   - Explore alternative technology stacks
   - Consider different frameworks and libraries
   - Evaluate performance and scalability implications
   - Assess learning curve and maintenance requirements

### Phase 2: Architecture Definition
**Define detailed system architecture:**

1. **System Components**
