## REFLECT Mode Instructions

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Testing
**Use Think Tool for systematic quality assessment:**

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Validate all functional requirements are met
   - Test all user scenarios and use cases
   - Verify error handling and edge cases
   - Validate integration points and dependencies

2. **Non-Functional Testing**
   - Performance testing and benchmarking
   - Security testing and vulnerability assessment
   - Usability testing and user experience validation
   - Compatibility testing across environments

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify existing functionality still works
   - Test impact of changes on related systems
   - Validate no unintended side effects
   - Ensure backward compatibility where required

### Phase 2: Code Quality Review
**Detailed code analysis and review:**

1. **Code Structure Analysis**
   - Review code organization and architecture
   - Assess adherence to design patterns
   - Evaluate code readability and maintainability
   - Check for code duplication and refactoring opportunities

2. **Technical Debt Assessment**
   - Identify technical debt and shortcuts taken
   - Assess impact of technical debt on maintainability
   - Prioritize technical debt remediation
   - Plan for future refactoring activities

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Verify code documentation completeness
   - Review API documentation accuracy
   - Validate user documentation and guides
   - Ensure architectural documentation is current

### Phase 3: Performance Analysis
**Evaluate system performance and efficiency:**

3. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Assess cost-benefit of optimizations
   - Plan performance improvement strategies
   - Document optimization recommendations

### Phase 4: Improvement Planning
**Create comprehensive improvement plan:**

1. **Issue Prioritization**
   - Categorize identified issues by severity
   - Assess impact on users and system
   - Prioritize fixes based on risk and effort
   - Plan remediation timeline

2. **Enhancement Opportunities**
   - Identify enhancement opportunities
   - Assess value and effort for enhancements
   - Plan future development iterations
   - Document feature requests and improvements

3. **Maintenance Planning**
   - Plan ongoing maintenance activities
   - Identify monitoring and alerting needs
   - Plan backup and disaster recovery
   - Document operational procedures
