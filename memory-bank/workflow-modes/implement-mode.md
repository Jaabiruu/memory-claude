# @IMPLEMENT Mode - Development & Execution

**Mode Purpose**: Convergent execution, code development, and feature implementation
**Position**: Core development phase for all complexity levels
**Think Tool Usage**: Progress validation and error prevention during coding

## Mode Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Code Implementation**: Develop features according to specifications
2. **Progressive Development**: Build incrementally with continuous validation
3. **Quality Assurance**: Implement with testing and code quality practices
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor development progress and adjust as needed
5. **Context Management**: Maintain development context and handle complexity

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All planned features implemented according to specifications
- [ ] Code quality standards maintained throughout development
- [ ] Tests written and passing for implemented features
- [ ] Progress tracked and documented continuously
- [ ] Context preserved through development cycles

## IMPLEMENT Mode Instructions

### Phase 1: Development Setup
**Prepare development environment:**

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Set up development environment and tools
   - Configure version control and branching strategy
   - Establish coding standards and linting rules
   - Set up testing framework and CI/CD pipeline

2. **Implementation Planning**
   - Review tasks.md for current implementation priorities
   - Plan development sequence and dependencies
   - Identify any remaining unknowns or risks
   - Prepare development workspace and resources

3. **Context Initialization**
   - Initialize context window monitoring
   - Set up progress tracking mechanisms
   - Prepare documentation and logging systems
   - Establish quality checkpoints

### Phase 2: Incremental Development
**Implement features incrementally:**

1. **Feature Development Cycle**
   - Select next feature from tasks.md
   - Implement core functionality
   - Write unit tests for new code
   - Perform local testing and validation
   - Update progress tracking

2. **Continuous Validation**
   - Run tests after each significant change
   - Validate against specifications
   - Check for integration issues
   - Perform code review and quality checks

3. **Progress Documentation**
   - Update progress.md with completion status
   - Document implementation decisions
   - Record any issues or challenges encountered
   - Update activeContext.md with current focus

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
**Maintain code quality throughout development:**

1. **Code Quality Practices**
   - Follow established coding standards
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add appropriate logging and monitoring
   - Ensure code is well-documented

2. **Testing Implementation**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Implement integration tests where appropriate
   - Perform manual testing for user-facing features
   - Validate performance and security requirements

3. **Refactoring and Optimization**
   - Refactor code for clarity and maintainability
   - Optimize performance where necessary
   - Remove code duplication and improve reusability
   - Ensure consistent patterns and architecture

### Phase 4: Context Management
**Handle development complexity and context:**

1. **Context Window Monitoring**
   - Monitor context usage throughout development
   - Trigger preservation protocol when thresholds reached
   - Document implementation progress before compaction
   - Maintain development continuity across sessions

2. **Progress Preservation**
   - Create detailed progress snapshots
   - Document current implementation state
   - Record next steps and immediate priorities
   - Preserve implementation decisions and rationale

3. **Knowledge Extraction**
   - Document patterns and solutions discovered
   - Record debugging insights and techniques
   - Save reusable code snippets and approaches
   - Update knowledge base with new learnings

## Required Outputs

### Continuous Updates
1. **tasks.md** (SACRED - Continuous Updates)
   - Mark completed tasks and subtasks
   - Update task status and progress
   - Add new tasks discovered during implementation
   - Document any scope changes or additions

2. **activeContext.md** (Frequent Updates)
   - Current implementation focus
   - Files being actively modified
   - Immediate next steps and priorities
   - Current challenges and blockers

3. **progress.md** (Regular Updates)
   - Feature completion status
   - Implementation milestones achieved
   - Quality metrics and test results
   - Timeline and effort tracking

### Implementation Artifacts
4. **Create implementation-log.md**
   - Detailed implementation decisions
   - Technical challenges and solutions
   - Code architecture and patterns used
   - Performance and optimization notes

5. **Create testing-results.md**
   - Test coverage and results
   - Manual testing outcomes
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security validation results

### Context Preservation
- **session-snapshots/**: Regular snapshots of implementation state
- **knowledge-base/**: Solutions and patterns discovered
- **active-session/**: Current implementation context

## Context Window Management

### Automatic Preservation Triggers
- **75% Context**: Warning - prepare for documentation
- **85% Context**: Document current implementation state
- **95% Context**: Force preservation and compaction

### Preservation Protocol
1. **Implementation State**
   - Current files being modified
   - Next immediate implementation steps
   - Current debugging or development focus
   - Pending testing and validation

2. **Progress Documentation**
   - Features completed in current session
   - Implementation decisions made
   - Problems solved and solutions found
   - Code patterns and approaches used

3. **Continuation Instructions**
   - Clear next steps for resuming implementation
   - Context needed for smooth continuation
   - Files to review and validate
   - Tests to run and verification steps
