# Claude Code Memory Bank - Quick Start Guide

**ðŸš€ Get started with the enhanced workflow system in under 2 minutes**

## Immediate Start Commands

### 1. Initialize New Project Workflow
```bash
@VAN  # Start with project analysis and complexity assessment
```

### 2. Continue Existing Project  
```bash
@resume-from latest  # Resume from last session
```

### 3. Work on Specific Subtask
```bash
@SUBTASK-VAN [task-name]  # Apply VAN analysis to subtask
@FRACTAL-WORKFLOW [task-name]  # Apply full workflow to complex subtask
```

## Essential Commands Reference

### Core Workflow Modes
- `@VAN` - Analyze and break down project/task
- `@PLAN` - Create implementation strategy  
- `@CREATIVE` - Explore design alternatives
- `@IMPLEMENT` - Code and build features
- `@REFLECT` - Quality assessment and testing
- `@ARCHIVE` - Document and preserve knowledge

### Fractal Workflow (Enhanced Feature)
- `@SUBTASK-VAN [task]` - Analyze specific subtask
- `@FRACTAL-WORKFLOW [task]` - Full workflow for complex subtask
- `@feedback-loop` - Integrate subtask results to project level

### Context Management
- `@context-status` - Check context usage
- `@preserve-now` - Save current state immediately
- `@compact-safe` - Preserve context and clear conversation

### Knowledge Management  
- `@patterns` - View discovered patterns
- `@decisions` - Review decisions made
- `@solutions [problem]` - Find solution to problem
- `@recall [topic]` - Search knowledge base

## Quick Workflow Paths

### Simple Project (Level 1)
```
@VAN â†’ @IMPLEMENT â†’ @REFLECT
```

### Moderate Project (Level 2)  
```
@VAN â†’ @PLAN â†’ @IMPLEMENT â†’ @REFLECT
```

### Complex Project (Level 3-4)
```
@VAN â†’ @PLAN â†’ @CREATIVE â†’ @IMPLEMENT â†’ @REFLECT â†’ @ARCHIVE
```

## Key Features

### âœ¨ Fractal Workflow Enhancement
- **What**: Apply full 6-mode workflow to individual subtasks
- **Why**: Better quality through cognitive specialization at all levels
- **When**: Complex subtasks (>4hrs, architectural impact, high risk)

### ðŸ§  Context Window Management
- **Automatic preservation** at 85% context usage
- **Seamless resumption** after `/compact`
- **Never lose progress** to context limitations

### ðŸ“š Knowledge Accumulation
- **Patterns learned** across all projects
- **Solutions found** for future reference  
- **Decisions made** with full rationale
- **Continuous learning** and improvement

## File Structure Quick Reference

```
memory-bank/
â”œâ”€â”€ core-files/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.md (SACRED - main task list)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ activeContext.md (current focus)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ progress.md (implementation status)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ complexity.md (complexity assessment)
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow-modes/ (mode instructions)
â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge-base/ (accumulated learnings)
â”œâ”€â”€ session-snapshots/ (context preservation)
â””â”€â”€ active-session/ (current session state)
```

## Success Tips

### ðŸŽ¯ Always Start with @VAN
- **Never skip** the VAN mode - it's mandatory
- Creates the **sacred tasks.md** file
- Establishes **complexity level** and **workflow path**

### ðŸ”„ Use Fractal Workflows for Complex Subtasks
- Apply when subtask is **>4 hours effort**
- Use for **architectural decisions**
- Apply to **high-risk or critical** subtasks

### ðŸ’¾ Trust the Context Management
- System **automatically preserves** at 85% context
- **Seamless resumption** after compaction
- Focus on work, not context management

### ðŸ“ˆ Leverage Knowledge Accumulation
- **Patterns** and **solutions** improve over time
- **Decision rationale** helps future projects
- **Continuous learning** across all work
