## ðŸ”„ Queue Management Procedures

### Item Addition Process

#### Automatic Queue Addition
```markdown
Triggered when evaluation score falls in manual review range:
1. Evaluation engine determines manual review needed
2. Item added to appropriate priority queue based on:
   - Proximity to auto-include threshold
   - Strategic importance indicators
   - Project context urgency
   - Category-specific priority rules

Priority Assignment Logic:
- High: Score within 0.5 of auto-include threshold
- High: Strategic keywords detected (architecture, performance, security)
- Medium: Standard manual review range
- Low: Lower end of review range, non-urgent context
```

#### Manual Queue Addition
```markdown
User Commands:
- #queue-for-review [item] [priority] - Add specific item to queue
- #bulk-queue [session|category] - Add multiple items for review
- #prioritize-review [item-id] [new-priority] - Change item priority
- #urgent-review [item] - Add item to high priority queue

Queue Addition Requirements:
- Item must have completed initial evaluation
- Rationale for manual review must be documented
- Context and suggested decision must be provided
- Review deadline must be set based on priority
```

### Review Processing Workflow

#### Review Session Initiation
```markdown
Command: #review-queue [priority|all]

Session Setup:
1. Display queue status and item count
2. Sort items by priority and age
3. Prepare evaluation context for each item
4. Begin systematic review process

Recommended Session Limits:
- High Priority: Process all items
- Medium Priority: 5-10 items per session
- Low Priority: 2-5 items per session
- Mixed Session: Prioritize high, then fill with medium/low
```

#### Individual Item Review Process
```markdown
For each item:
1. Display full evaluation context and scoring breakdown
2. Show Think tool analysis if available
3. Present suggested decision with rationale
4. Prompt for user decision: Approve|Reject|Modify|Skip
5. Collect user rationale for decision
6. Update curation-log.md with decision details
7. Process next item or end session

User Decision Options:
- Approve: Include in knowledge base as-is
- Reject: Exclude from knowledge base with rationale
- Modify: Edit item before inclusion
- Skip: Defer decision to later session
- Force Include: Override low score with justification
- Force Exclude: Override high score with justification
```

#### Batch Processing Options
```markdown
Available for similar items:
- #approve-batch [category] [criteria] - Approve multiple similar items
- #reject-batch [category] [criteria] - Reject multiple similar items
- #clear-queue [priority] - Process entire priority level
- #auto-process [score-threshold] - Auto-approve above threshold

Batch Processing Safeguards:
- Require confirmation for batch operations
- Limit batch size to prevent accidental mass operations
- Maintain detailed audit trail for batch decisions
- Allow individual review within batch operations
```

### Priority Assignment Criteria

#### High Priority Indicators
```markdown
Score-Based:
- Within 0.5 points of auto-include threshold
- Conflicting high/low criteria scores requiring analysis
- Novel patterns with strategic potential
- Critical decisions affecting project architecture

Context-Based:
- Active project blockers requiring immediate decision
- Time-sensitive knowledge with decreasing relevance
- Strategic knowledge for upcoming project phases
- Cross-project applicability with immediate need

Content-Based:
- Security-related patterns or solutions
- Performance optimization discoveries
- Architecture decision frameworks
- Critical bug fixes or debugging techniques
```

#### Medium Priority Indicators
```markdown
Score-Based:
- Standard manual review range scores
- Moderate novelty with uncertain reusability

### Dynamic Priority Adjustment

#### Automatic Priority Updates
```markdown
Age-Based Escalation:
- Items older than 7 days: +1 priority level
- Items older than 14 days: +2 priority levels (max High)
- Items older than 30 days: Flag for urgent review or auto-process

Context-Based Escalation:
- Related project work starting: Increase priority
- Deadline approaching: Escalate relevant items
- Similar items being processed: Batch priority increase
- User searching for related topics: Increase priority

Score-Based Adjustments:
- If threshold optimization suggests higher value: Increase priority
- If similar items consistently approved: Increase priority
- If category shows high auto-include accuracy: Decrease priority
- If user frequently overrides category: Increase priority
```

#### Manual Priority Management
```markdown
User Commands:
- #escalate [item-id] [reason] - Increase item priority
- #de-escalate [item-id] [reason] - Decrease item priority
- #urgent [item-id] - Move to high priority immediately
- #defer [item-id] [days] - Lower priority for specified time

Priority Change Documentation:
- Record original and new priority levels
- Document rationale for priority change
- Track effectiveness of priority adjustments
- Update priority assignment algorithms based on outcomes
```
