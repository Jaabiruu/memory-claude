## ⚙️ Threshold Management System

### Adaptive Threshold Adjustment

#### Performance-Based Optimization
```markdown
Monthly Review Process:
1. Analyze curation decision effectiveness
2. Calculate manual override rates by category
3. Assess user satisfaction with curated content
4. Identify threshold adjustment opportunities

Optimization Triggers:
- Manual override rate > 20% for any category
- User satisfaction below 80% for search results
- Automatic exclusion of later-valued information
- Automatic inclusion of low-value information
```

#### Threshold Adjustment Algorithm
```markdown
Adjustment Factors:
- Override Rate Impact: -0.1 to +0.1 per 5% override rate deviation
- User Satisfaction Impact: -0.2 to +0.2 based on satisfaction trends
- Search Effectiveness Impact: -0.15 to +0.15 based on result relevance
- Knowledge Reuse Rate: -0.1 to +0.1 based on actual utilization

Maximum Adjustment Per Period: ±0.3 points
Minimum Review Period: 30 days
Adjustment Documentation: Required for all changes
```

### Context-Sensitive Thresholds

#### Project Type Adjustments
```markdown
Research Projects:
- Increase novelty weight by 10%
- Decrease validation requirements by 5%
- Lower auto-include thresholds by 0.3

Production Projects:
- Increase validation weight by 10%
- Increase impact requirements by 5%
- Raise auto-include thresholds by 0.2

Maintenance Projects:
- Increase reusability weight by 15%
- Focus on tested solutions
- Maintain standard thresholds
```

#### Domain-Specific Adjustments
```markdown
Frontend Development:
- Emphasize reusability for UI patterns
- Higher thresholds for code snippets
- Lower thresholds for design decisions

Backend Development:
- Emphasize impact for architectural patterns
- Higher validation requirements
- Focus on scalability and performance

DevOps/Infrastructure:
- Emphasize generalizability across environments
- Higher validation requirements for reliability
- Focus on automation and maintenance reduction
```

## 🔧 Configuration Management

### User Customization Commands

#### Threshold Adjustment Commands
