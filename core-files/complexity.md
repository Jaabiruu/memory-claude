# Project Complexity Assessment

## Complexity Level: Ready for Assessment

### Assessment Criteria

**Level 1 (Simple)**
- Single feature or small enhancement
- Minimal dependencies
- Straightforward implementation
- Limited testing requirements
- **Workflow**: @VAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT

**Level 2 (Moderate)**
- Multiple related features
- Some external dependencies
- Moderate complexity
- Standard testing requirements
- **Workflow**: @VAN → @PLAN → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT

**Level 3 (Complex)**
- System-level changes
- Architectural decisions required
- Multiple dependencies and integrations
- Comprehensive testing needed
- **Workflow**: @VAN → @PLAN → @CREATIVE → @IMPLEMENT → @REFLECT → @ARCHIVE

**Level 4 (Enterprise)**
- Large-scale system changes
- Multiple team coordination
- Complex architectural patterns
- Full validation and documentation
- **Workflow**: Full 6-mode with iterations

## Current Project Assessment

### Complexity Indicators
*Will be populated during @VAN mode*

### Recommended Workflow Path
*Will be determined after complexity assessment*

### Rationale
*Reasoning for complexity level assignment*

---
*Last Updated: Initial creation*
*Assessment Required: Use @VAN mode to determine complexity*
